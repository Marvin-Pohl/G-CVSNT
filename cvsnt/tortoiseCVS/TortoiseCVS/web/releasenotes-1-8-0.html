<h1>Release Notes for version 1.8.0</h1>

<p>
The TortoiseCVS development team is proud to announce version 1.8.0 of an enjoyable CVS client for Windows. 
<p>
<a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org">TortoiseCVS</a> integrates CVS version
control directly into Windows Explorer.  You can right click on files and
folders to commit, update and fully use CVS.  Icons are highlighted in
different colours to show they are in CVS or that you have changed them.
<p>
It's freely available <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/download.shtml">for download</a> under the GPL.
<p>
There are lots of bug fixes and new features since the last stable release;
for full details see the <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/stablechangelog.shtml">change log</a>.  Here
are some changes that we are particularly proud of:

<ul>
<li><p><b>Updated User Guide.</b>
	The User Guide has been subjected to a long-needed update and now covers most of the
	functionality offered in TortoiseCVS. Comments and additions are of course very welcome.
<li><p><b>New Add dialog with treeview.</b>
	The Add Contents now display the candidate files in an Explorer-like dialog with a treeview
	on the left and a list of files on the right. Various sorting methods and commands can be
	applied to make it easy to select the right files.
<li><p><b>Improved Commit dialog.</b>
	The comment field now defaults to empty, and Ctrl-Up/Ctrl-Down select from comment history.
	It is also possible to automatically insert line breaks after each 80 characters.
<li><p><b>Annotate support.</b>
	The CVS Annotate command shows the output of "cvs annotate" in a special dialog
	and optionally highlights by author, date, or age. It is also possible to retrieve 
	and compare revisions just like in the History and Revision Graph dialogs.
<li><p><b>Visual indication of mergepoints.</b>
	The Revision Graph dialog indicates mergepoints with coloured arrows.
<li><p><b>All SSH parameters are user-definable.</b>
	It is now easy to e.g. force SSH version 2 without resorting to batch files.
<li><p><b>Improved Make Patch.</b>
	It is now possible to include added files which are not in CVS into a patch.
</ul>

<p>We hope you continue to enjoy TortoiseCVS as much as we do.

<p>Check it out,

<p>Charlie Vernon Smythe
<br>On behalf of the TortoiseCVS development team

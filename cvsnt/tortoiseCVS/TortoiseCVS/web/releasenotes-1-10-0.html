<h1>Release Notes for version 1.10.1</h1>

<p>
The TortoiseCVS development team is proud to announce version 1.10.1 of an enjoyable CVS client for Windows. 
<p>
<a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org">TortoiseCVS</a> integrates CVS version
control directly into Windows Explorer.  You can right click on files and
folders to commit, update and fully use CVS.  Icons are highlighted in
different colours to show they are in CVS or that you have changed them.
<p>
It's freely available <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/download.shtml">for download</a> under the GPL.
<p>
There are lots of bug fixes and new features since the last stable release;
for full details see the <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/stablechangelog.shtml">change log</a>.  Here
are some changes that we are particularly proud of:

<ul>
<li><b>Installer no longer requires a reboot.</b>
	The installer now offers to restart Explorer where necessary, so that you can install and upgrade TortoiseCVS
	without reboots.
<li><b>Support for 64-bit Windows.</b>
	TortoiseCVS now supports x64 versions of Windows natively.
<li><b>Per-module preferences.</b>
	Preferences can now be set both globally and for a specific module.
<li><b>Improved Revision Graph dialog.</b>
	You can now hide tags to reduce clutter in the graph.<br>
	You can choose to omit 'uninteresting' revisions.<br>
	When you select a revision, any mergepoint arrows are highlighted.
<li><b>Improved Edit functionality.</b>
	TortoiseCVS can now be configured to allow entering a comment when doing CVS Edit, and you can also use
	reserved edits.<br>
	The List Editors dialog is also much improved.
<li><b>Bug number support.</b>
	All relevant commands now support the "bug number" functionality in CVSNT.<br>
	Bug numbers in commit comments can be automatically converted to hyperlinks to a bug tracking system.
<li><b>Support for renaming.</b>
	The 'cvs rename' command is now supported for CVSNT servers.
<li><b>Repository browser.</b>
	In the Checkout dialog, you can now browse through the files and folders available on the server.
<li><b>Improved localization support.</b>
	TortoiseCVS now uses UTF-8 internally to avoid codepage problems. Many new translations have also been added.
</ul>

<p>We hope you continue to enjoy TortoiseCVS as much as we do.

<p>Check it out,

<p>Charlie Vernon Smythe
<br>On behalf of the TortoiseCVS development team

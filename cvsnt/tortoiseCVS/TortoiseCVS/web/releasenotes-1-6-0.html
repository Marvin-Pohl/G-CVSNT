<h1>TortoiseCVS 1.6.0 - enjoyable version control</h1>

<p>The TortoiseCVS development team is proud to announce version 1.6.0 of an enjoyable CVS client for Windows. 

<p><a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org">TortoiseCVS</a> integrates CVS version control directly into Windows Explorer.  You can right click on files and folders to commit, update and fully use CVS.  Icons are highlighted in different colours to show they are in CVS or that you have changed them.

<p>It's freely available <a
href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/download.shtml">for download</a> under
the GPL.

<p>There are lots of bug fixes and new features since the last stable release; for full details see the <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/stablechangelog.shtml">change log</a>.  Here are some changes that we are particularly proud of:

<ul>

<li><p> <b>Improved History Dialog.</b> The History dialog displays branches and tags more intuitively.

<li><p> <b>Even better SSH support.</b> It is now very easy to specify additional SSH parameters.

<li><p> <b>Improved performance of recursive folder status.</b> The recursive status of a folder can now be cached, 
if so desired. This greatly improves Explorer performance on slower machines.

<li><p> <b>Better support for multiple monitors and large fonts.</b> This means that TortoiseCVS now 
also works for less-common setups.

<li><p> <b>Seamless Unix line ending support.</b> TortoiseCVS now automatically detects if a sandbox uses Unix or Windows
line endings and copes with either case.

</ul>

<p>We hope you continue to enjoy TortoiseCVS as much as we do.

<p>Check it out,

<p>Charlie Vernon Smythe

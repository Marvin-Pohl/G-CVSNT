<h1>Release Notes for version 1.12.1</h1>

<p>
The TortoiseCVS development team is proud to announce version 1.12.1 of an enjoyable CVS client for Windows. 
<p>
<a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org">TortoiseCVS</a> integrates CVS version
control directly into Windows Explorer.  You can right click on files and
folders to commit, update and fully use CVS.  Icons are highlighted in
different colours to show they are in CVS or that you have changed them.
<p>
It's freely available <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/download.shtml">for download</a> under the GPL.
<p>
There are lots of bug fixes and new features since the last stable release;
for full details see the <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/stablechangelog.shtml">change log</a>.  Here
are some changes that we are particularly proud of:

<ul>
<li><b>Use TortoiseOverlays.</b> TortoiseCVS now uses the TortoiseOverlays mechanism
(developed by the TortoiseSVN team) to avoid overlay icon conflicts with other Tortoise clients.
<li><b>Better bug number support.</b> This feature was contributed by March Hare.
</ul>

<p>We hope you continue to enjoy TortoiseCVS as much as we do.

<p>Check it out,

<p>Charlie Vernon Smythe
<br>On behalf of the TortoiseCVS development team

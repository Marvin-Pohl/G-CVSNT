Docbook Documentation
=====================

How To Generate the Documentation
---------------------------------

1) We use the >e-novative> DocBook Environment (eDE) for generating
   HTML Help from DocBook XML. Download it from 
   http://www.e-novative.info/software/ede/ede_download.php and install it.

2) From a command-promt in the TortoiseCVS/docs directory type:

   build

   This will generate HTML Help for the English documentation.

<h1>TortoiseCVS client installation - easiest SSH integrated into Windows</h1>

<i>Description:</i> How to get version control directly within Windows
Explorer, including ready-to-eat SSH.

<h2>TortoiseCVS Client Installation Instructions</h2>

<p>This document provides instructions for installing and using the
TortoiseCVS CVS client software. These instructions are designed for
SourceForge.net project developers who are using 32-bit Microsoft
Windows platform.  It is for developers who would like to work with the
source code for a project which is hosted on SourceForge.net.  For
background information you may like to read the other available
documents about CVS.

<p>TortoiseCVS has advantages over WinCVS for work on SourceForge.  It
has a clearer interface which is integrated into Windows Explorer.
WinCVS has a more complex and mature interface.  For more obscure
commands it may be easier or necessary to use WinCVS.

<p>A particular benefit is that TortoiseCVS has an SSH client built into
it, without special setup.  Anyone can easily commit code to
SourceForge.net projects using TortoiseCVS.

<h2>Installing TortoiseCVS</h2>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org">tortoisecvs.org</a> and
download version 1.6.14 or a later stable version from the Download page.
<li>To install, run the executable and follow the instructions.
<li>Since TortoiseCVS is a shell extension, you need to reboot your
machine.
</ol>

<h2>Checking out an existing project</h2>

<p>If you are working on an existing project first you now need to check
out the code.

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have made an account on SourceForge.net, and that you
have been added as a developer to the project you are going to work on.
A project administrator needs to do this.

<li>In Windows Explorer go to the folder that you would like to check
the code out into.

<li>Right click and from the context menu choose the command "CVS
Checkout"; it's next to the tortoise icon.

<li>You will need your user name on SourceForge.net, and the project
UNIX name.  Fill in the dialog as follows:

<ul>
<li>Protocol: Secure Shell
<li>Server: cvs.sourceforge.net
<li>Directory: /cvsroot/projectname
<li>Username: username
</ul>

<li>Click "Fetch List" to get a choice of modules.  You will need to
enter your password in the dialog at this point.  Then pick the module
that you would like.

<li>Choose OK.  TortoiseCVS will now check out the code.  You will need
to enter your password.

<li>You can now alter files and then select "CVS Commit" on the top
level directory to make your changes in the repository.  For more
information read the <a
href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/guide.html">TortoiseCVS Daily Use
Guide</a>.

</ol>

<p><b>Get an error?</b>
If you get an error saying something like "<i>Could not chdir to home
directory /home/users/r/rd/rdonkin: No such file or directory</i>" then
you need to log into the server with SSH to force creation of your home
directory. Do this by connecting to username@cvs.sf.net
either with <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty</a>
or a command line SSH. 

<h2>Working on a new project</h2>

<p>If you are working on a new project then you first need to create a
new module in the repository.

<ol>
<li>Create a directory with the name you would like the module to have.
<li>Put the files you would like to add in the directory.
<li>Right click on the directory, and choose Make New Module from the
CVS submenu.
<li>Fill in the dialog as described in the previous section.  Note
that the module name is filled in for you.
<li>Choose OK.  You will need to enter your password twice, and the 
module will be made for you.
<li>Proceed to add files and folders by right clicking on them
and choosing "CVS Add" or "CVS Add All Recursively" from the context
menu.
<li>You can now "CVS Commit" everything, by right clicking on the top
level folder.
<li>For more information read the <a
href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/guide.html">TortoiseCVS Daily Use
Guide</a>.
</ol>

<h2>Tired of entering your password all the time?</h2>

<p>You need to make a public/private key pair. The public key goes on the
server, and the private key sits on your hard drive. Now, when you
connect the server can verify who you are because only you have your
private key.

<p>To further protect your private key it is encrypted on your hard disk
with a passphrase. You can however choose an empty passphrase, in which
case you never have to enter a password but anyone with access to your
computer can access your SSH CVS account. Or you can use an SSH Agent
(such as Pageant) which will remember your passphrase for the duration
of one session, so you only have to enter it once.

<p>TortoiseCVS uses a version of Plink as its SSH client.  This means
you can use PuTTYgen to make a public/private key pair, and you can use
Pageant to point to where the private key is.  First of all download
them both from the
<a
href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY
website</a>.

<p>For information on how to use them read the
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html">PuTTY
documentation</a> on PuTTYgen and Pageant.
In particular, make sure you read the sections "8.2: Using PuTTYgen,
the PuTTY key generator" and "9.3.1 Making Pageant automatically load
keys on startup".


<p>After making your public key with PuTTYgen you need to upload it
using the SourceForge.net web interface. Log into the SourceForge web
site, and go to your Account Preferences page. Down at the bottom is a
section "Shell Account Information" with an entry "CVS/SSH Shared
Authorized Keys". You need to add your public key there.

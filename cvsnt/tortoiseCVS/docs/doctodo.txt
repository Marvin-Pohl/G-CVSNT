Daily use guide
---------------

	- Section on checkout dialog needs revamping (particularly once
	we've refactored that dialog again)

More detailed docs
------------------

Perhaps we should have a "Top Tips FAQ" type section.  It would show
of the slightly hiddden features in section titled "How to automatically
launch an editor for ever file containing a conflict".  This would
be a document in between a FAQ and the Daily Use Guide, and would
contain anything cool or interesting that we want to say.  For advanced
uses - we assume all knowledge that is in the Daily Use Guide, and
document anything else that is otherwise unmentioned (and not mentioned
in the FAQ).

As a concept, I like the idea of each thing only being documented once.
